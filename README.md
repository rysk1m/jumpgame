Introduction
This project is a simple arcade game built with JavaScript, where the player controls a character that must jump to avoid moving obstacles. The game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic interaction and an engaging user experience.
1. Project Description
The "Simple Jump Game" is a game where the player controls a character using the Space key. The player must avoid colliding with moving obstacles that appear on the screen. The game features dynamic difficulty: as the score increases, the speed of obstacles increases, and the player needs to press the Space key at the right time to jump.
Key Features:
•	Character control using the Space key.
•	Dynamic difficulty: obstacle speed increases as the score goes up.
•	High score table: displaying the best scores.
•	Game restart: allows the player to restart the game after it ends.
2. Technologies Used in the Project
  1.	HTML: Structure of the web page.
  2.	CSS: Styling and design of game elements.
  3.	JavaScript: Game logic, event handling, and user interaction.
3. User Guide
How to Start:
1.	Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2.	Use the Space key to make the character jump.
How to Avoid Collisions:
•	Jump to avoid colliding with the moving obstacles. If the obstacle comes too close, the game will end.
How to Restart the Game:
•	After the game ends, press the "Restart" button to start the game again.

4. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of fundamental JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and animations to create an interactive and engaging game. It includes handling dynamic content updates, responding to user input, and creating a game loop to manage the game’s logic. The project also provides a simple but effective example of how to manage the game state and improve user experience with sound effects, animations, and a high score system.
